Welcome to my website! I am currently a PhD student in Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at [The University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/), co-supervised by [Dr. Yanmin Gong](https://yanmingong.github.io/) and [Dr. Yuanxiong Guo](https://guoyuanxiong.github.io/). I received B.S. degrees in Energy and Power Engineering at [Chongqing University](https://english.cqu.edu.cn/).

My current research focuses on **Federated Learning**, **Large Language Model**, and **Stable Diffusion**. I also contributed to the [LyCORIS](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS) project by developing several algorithms aimed for improving fine-tuning efficiency, including the [LoHa](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS/blob/main/docs/Algo-List.md#loha) algorithm. Our mission is to develop AI models that are more secure, private, efficient, and personalized, pushing forward the boundaries of AI accessibility and customization. <br><br>
